Summary: 

Below is the Previous Research and Proposed Research sections of the application. 

I submitted the same research to Hubble and to NSF AAPF.  I got the Hubble, but the NSF panel rated my proposal extremely poorly.  Just goes to show the variance in panel reviews and hopefully helps soften the blow when others see that itâ€™s largely stochastic at some point whether you get a good review or not.
